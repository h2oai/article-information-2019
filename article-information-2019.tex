% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{This text outlines a viable approach for training and evaluating complex machine learning systems for high-stakes, human-centered, or regulated applications using common Python programming tools. The accuracy and intrinsic interpretability of two types of constrained models, monotonic gradient boosting machines (M-GBM) and explainable neural networks (XNN), a deep learning architecture well-suited for structured data, are assessed on simulated datasets with known feature importance and sociological bias characteristics and on realistic, publicly available example datasets. For maximum transparency and the potential generation of personalized adverse action notices, the constrained models are analyzed using post-hoc explanation techniques including plots of individual conditional expectation (ICE) and global and local gradient-based or Shapley feature importance. The constrained model predictions are also tested for disparate impact and other types of sociological bias using straightforward group fairness measures. By combining innovations in interpretable models, post-hoc explanation, and bias testing with accessible software tools, this text aims to provide a template workflow for important machine learning applications that require high accuracy and interpretability and low disparate impact.}

%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph. 

%Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:

%\begin{Theorem}
%Example text of a theorem.
