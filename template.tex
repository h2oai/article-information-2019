\documentclass[journal,article,submit,moreauthors,pdftex]{Definitions/mdpi} 

% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\section{How to Use this Template}
The template details the sections that can be used in a manuscript. Note that the order and names of article sections may differ from the requirements of the journal (e.g., the positioning of the Materials and Methods section). Please check the instructions for authors page of the journal to verify the correct order and names. For any questions, please contact the editorial office of the journal or support@mdpi.com. For LaTeX related questions please contact latex@mdpi.com.
%The order of the section titles is: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions for these journals: aerospace,algorithms,antibodies,antioxidants,atmosphere,axioms,biomedicines,carbon,crystals,designs,diagnostics,environments,fermentation,fluids,forests,fractalfract,informatics,information,inventions,jfmk,jrfm,lubricants,neonatalscreening,neuroglia,particles,pharmaceutics,polymers,processes,technologies,viruses,vision

\section{Introduction}
The introduction should briefly place the study in a broad context and highlight why it is important. It should define the purpose of the work and its significance. The current state of the research field should be reviewed carefully and key publications cited. Please highlight controversial and diverging hypotheses when necessary. Finally, briefly mention the main aim of the work and highlight the principal conclusions. As far as possible, please keep the introduction comprehensible to scientists outside your particular field of research. Citing a journal paper \cite{ref-journal}. And now citing a book reference \cite{ref-book}. Please use the command \citep{ref-journal} for the following MDPI journals, which use author-date citation: Administrative Sciences, Arts, Econometrics, Economies, Genealogy, Humanities, IJFS, JRFM, Languages, Laws, Religions, Risks, Social Sciences.

\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is an example of an equation:

\begin{equation}
a + b = c
\end{equation}
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph. 

Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase `of Theorem 1' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}
The text continues here.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}

Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted in perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Materials and Methods}

Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, computer code, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly available database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

Interventionary studies involving animals or humans, and other studies require ethical approval must list the authority that provided approval and the corresponding ethical approval code.

The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text.
