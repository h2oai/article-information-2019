1-15: The abstract is often regarded as a "standalone" entity, so I wouldn't define the abbreviations (MGBMs, XNNs, PD etc.) there but in the main text (where they are first mentioned)

>> All abbreviations removed from abstract and associated with the first appearance of the phrase in the main text.

18: The section numbering currently starts at 0 ("0. Introduction"). I recommend starting it with 1, i.e., "1. Introduction" "2. Materials and Methods" and so forth

>> Corrected, changed \setcounter{section}{0} from \setcounter{section}{-1}, which was MDPI default(?)

51: Add missing Oxford comma -> "constrained ML models, and ..."

>> This was not intended to be a list. Reformatted sentence to, hopefully, be more clear: To provide a sense of fit differences, performance is compared on simulated data and collected mortgage data between the more interpretable constrained ML models and the less interpretable unconstrained ML models. Lines 50 - 53.

92: add a reference/citation for HDMA database

>> See line 50 and new reference 12.

201-205: It's great that you listed all the packages for reproducibility. Would be even better with version numbers

>> Version numbers added in text, and previously available in requirements.txt: https://github.com/h2oai/article-information-2019/blob/master/requirements.txt. Still lines 201 - 205.

Table 1 & 2: Optionally, you can highlight the best result in each column via bold font.

>> Best results in each table column are now bold.

230: Instead of starting the sentence with "1a" you can start the sentence with either "Figure 1a" or "Subpanel 1a"

>> Corrected this (still line 230) and two other similar occurrences in new section 3.2.2.

260: tensorflow -> TensorFlow

>> Corrected, still line 260.

263: You say "area under the curve (AUC)"; would be more informative to say "receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC)"

>> Corrected, now line 263-264.

Figure 2, 5, A2, A5: add x-axis label

>> x-axis labels added.

396: Add citation for EBM and GA2M

>> citations added, now line 396 - 397.

429: The sentence starts with "Writ large" --> I think that's a typo?

>> Not sure, but deleted. Still line 429.
